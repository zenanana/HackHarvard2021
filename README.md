# Justice
### HackHarvard

Project Name: Justice
Elevator Pitch: (200 char)
Justice - a platform to champion the social issues close to your heart and build communities with peers passionate about the same causes! 

‚ÄúJustice‚Äù builds a community of awareness for social issues, allowing users to champion the causes they believe in and build communities with peers passionate for the same causes.

About the Project:

## Inspiration
The following three reasons inspired the creation of Justice:

There are many social movements (e.g. BLM) which are happening, but the efforts are spread across many social media platforms. We want to make it centralized. Discussing social issues requires maturity - which is why we feel a new platform, without the distractions of today‚Äôs social media, is necessary.

1. There has been much effort for various social issues. However, information about those efforts are sparsely spread across the many social media platforms that the world currently has. We want to concentrate the discussion of and efforts for social issues into one platform, free from the distractions and judgements.



Many people may find it difficult to visualize the ‚Äúprogress‚Äù of a social issue. Hence, it will be beneficial to have a timeline, consisting of broad directions (big arrows) and little steps (small arrows), so that anyone can see what has been done. It acts as a record of community efforts (e.g. drafting of policies, conferences, protests, rallies) for the social issue.

Finally, we believe that every single individual has a set of causes that they wish to champion. We feel that they should be proud of their strong beliefs in these causes and be able to find similar individuals with the same beliefs. Justice is a new platform with the ability for people to freely display what causes they wish to champion, allowing for better networking and the ability to combine efforts to stir movements.


## What it does
Fear not, because ‚ÄúJustice‚Äù is here! Justice is a platform purely for the discussion of social issues  where users can choose to champion or participate in those which they are passionate about. ‚ÄúJustice‚Äù comes with five main features:

Repertoire of Social Issues
Allows individuals to view social issues, including those that are popular or trending. Each issue has its own database of useful information, including curated descriptions and links to educational videos and articles.
Progress Tracking - (Big arrows) of social issues
A timeline of events, which records community efforts done to advance the social cause. This provides a centralized information hub/library regarding previous and present efforts regarding a social cause.
Broadcasting of Events - Create and announce events
Allows users to see the events that are happening now (marked with a radiating purple dot). This helps users keep track of events they can participate in in real-time, allowing for greater user-cause interaction.
Chatroom and Commenting
‚ÄòJustice‚Äô gives users the ability to talk and add thoughts about each issue. Users are able to use this feature to not only actively engage less-interested individuals, but also organize events related to the issues.
User Profile
Displaying top contributions and interests of users on their user page, so that (1) they can be proud of the issues that they are championing and (2) others with similar interests can reach out to them.

## How we built it
We built it using ReactJS as the frontend, Flask as the backend and SQLite3 as the database.

## Challenges we ran into
Building a complete full-stack application within the time limit is very stressful. Particularly even more so during a weekend before the midterms üòõ

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Completing a full-stack application within 32 hours

## What we learned
Probably not doing a full-stack application for the next hackathon üòÇ

## What's next for Justice
The community concept, smaller community within the larger social issues (like maybe separated by geographical locations, schools) - measure progress in a smaller community.
Location, find events by locations
Leaders for each social issue.


Built with: ReactJS, Flask, SQLite
